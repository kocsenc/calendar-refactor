Calendar Refactor
=================
The goal is to document and partially implement (time permitting) several
refactorings to an older project that no one in the team of five had seen
before.  The takeaway from this project is to understand and overcome the
challenges in tackling legacy systems with poor documentation and an even worse
codebase.

Documentation
-------------

See the refactor-docs/ folder for more detailed information about the kinds of
refactorings that were planned, our analysis of the original product, and a
breakdown of some of the implemented suggested changes that were made to the
system.

Dependencies
